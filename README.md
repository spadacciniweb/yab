# benchmark

Despite its name, this project isn't intended to provide any benchmarks between different languages. Instead, for each problem, a solution has been sought for each language that was as similar as possible
For some scripts, however, the .quick solution has been proposed, which provides an idiomatic or at least improved version of the same script.
